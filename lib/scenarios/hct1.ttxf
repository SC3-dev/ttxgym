! title: Heightened cyber threat
! summary
This scenario explores an incident which leads to an increased threat of cyber attack.
This could be the result of a new zero-day exploit that is actively being used, negative press surrounding your organisation or geo-political tensions between your country and another nation state.
Organisations should be prepared to react during periods of heightened cyber threat.
You are encouraged to discuss how this would impact your organisation, including how you manage your systems effectively to detect such a threat, and what you would do in the event of being subject to an increased level of cyber threat.
You can also discuss your approach to cyber insurance, and long-term resilience planning.

@ Stage 1: Fundamentals
! content
In ‘business as usual’ circumstances it is important to ensure some fundamental cyber security controls are in-place to reduce the risk of a cyber attack.
Understanding your current cyber posture will help you to effectively respond to reports of a heightened cyber threat situation.

@ Stage 2: Increased cyber threat

Geo-political tensions have heightened the cyber threat level.
There has not been any direct threat to your organisation however it is believed that organisations in the same sector as you are likely to be targeted.
This section explores what your reaction is to an increased cyber threat to your organisation and actions you can take.
Participants should focus on the potential threat of cyber attack.

@ Stage 3: Government and media reporting
! content
The media are reporting several websites and local government services have been taken offline and are not accessible.
It is reported that widespread cyber attacks are taking place in the form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), website defacements, and ransomware attacks.
This section explores your organisation’s reaction when organisations and government services start to come under cyber attack.
Questions in this section relate to your gathering of information that may provide indications of the tactics and techniques of the adversary, understanding of your supply chain risk, and consideration of any cyber insurance you may have.
This information can then be used to defend your organisation more effectively.

# discussion
+ Where can you get information including threat intelligence that can help you protect and defend your organisation?
+ What type of information do you want that you can use to strengthen your defences?
+ Are you aware of your supply chain risks and any potential impact to your organisation?
