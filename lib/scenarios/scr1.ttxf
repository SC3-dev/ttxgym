! title: Supply Chain Ransomware
! summary
This scenario explores an incident in which a major supplier integrated with your operations is subject to a ransomware attack.
The ransomware subsequently spreads to your organisation.
The commercialisation of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) by criminals has been a significant factor in the growth of ransomware attacks.
You should be prepared to respond to a ransomware attack to ensure that you can limit the impact to operations.
You are encouraged to discuss how you will respond, initially to the supplier incident and then to your incident, and your response to subsequent demands for payment from criminals.
You can also discuss your approach to cyber insurance, and your communications in response to a leak of sensitive data.
