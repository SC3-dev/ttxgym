! title: Being attacked from an unknown wifi network
! summary
This exercise scenario covers the entire sequence of events that could occur when a user connects to an unknown wifi network.
It discusses the risks taken when connected to such a wifi network and how an attacker may use that to access a user’s device, such as a laptop.
The use of outdated software is also covered as a method of the attacker compromising the user’s device.
@ Inject 1: Wifi Connection
! content
While waiting for a meeting, a user connects to the free, unsecured wifi available at a coffee shop.
They are using their device with the intention of editing documents and responding to emails.
# discussion
+ How do you support users in identifying unsecured wifi hotspots and understanding the dangers of connecting to them?
+ What technical alternatives do you provide for users to help them avoid the dangers of unknown wifi hotspots?
+ Do you provide access to mobile (3G or 4G) networks or operate a Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)?
+ How are laptops configured to prevent other network users from accessing them?
+ For example, is the device firewall configured and enabled?
# prompts
+ How do we teach users to know when it’s safe to connect to wifi hotspots?
+ Are users able to connect to any wifi network that they want to?
+ If using a VPN, is it enabled by default, or does a user have to know how to enable it?
+ How are firewalls setup?
+ Can users or applications modify the firewall rules, or disable the firewall?
? Our users are provided with sufficient education and tools to either avoid using unknown wifi hotspots, or to use them in a secure fashion.

@ Inject 2: Software Updates
! content
Unbeknownst to the user, the wifi network is actually operated by a hacker trying to catch unsuspecting business users.
They scan the user’s laptop for outdated software and try to attack any vulnerable software that they can identify.
# discussion
+ How does your organisation ensure that devices you issue are kept up to date?
+ How does your organisation ensure that the apps you use are kept up to date?
+ How does that differ under a BYOD (Bring your own device) policy?
# prompts
+ Are devices set to automatically apply updates?
+ Can users delay updates?
+ Is software centrally managed and updated, or is each application configured to do its own updating?
+ Do we ask users to keep their devices and software up to date?
+ What happens if users don’t keep their devices and software up to date?
? We ensure the software and operating systems on organisation issued devices are up to date.

@ Inject 3: User Permissions
! content
The hacker identifies some outdated software on the user’s device and uses an exploit to compromise the device.
They now have access to everything on the device, including any accounts the user is logged in to, such as email and file sharing services.
# discussion
+ To what extent would the user be setup where they only have the lowest level of user rights required to perform their role?
+ Are normal users setup as administrators of their computers?
+ Would a user and therefore the attacker be able to install new applications without extra permissions?
+ What additional protections are used with important accounts, such as HR or financial systems?
+ Is two-factor authentication setup for these services?
# prompts
+ Do users have administrator permissions?
+ Can users access other users’ files or data?
+ What happens when the user tries to install new software or applications?
+ Are any accounts given extra protection?
+ Do we use two-factor authentication anywhere?
? User accounts are configured according to the principle of “least privilege”, where they only have the lowest level of user rights required to perform their role.

? We have a clear policy requiring our organisation's systems are configured with multi-factor authentication.
