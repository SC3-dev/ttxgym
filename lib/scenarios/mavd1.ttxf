! title: Managing a vulnerability disclosure
! author: UK Crown Copyright / NCSC
! summary
This scenario covers the events following the disclosure of a vulnerability in a public facing web application run by your organisation.
It includes managing communication between your organisation and a person reporting a vulnerability.
It also covers the process of responding to a vulnerability disclosure.
Finally, it looks at mitigating further problems by implementing an effective vulnerability disclosure process.

@ Inject 1: Vulnerability disclosure received
! content
An employee manages your organisation’s official social media account and receives the following message:
"beta.example.com points to a cloud instance that can be registered by an attacker to take over the domain.
Steps To Reproduce: Do a CNAME lookup for each domain.
Take the resource and register it on your cloud service provider.
Redirect cloud resource to malicious infrastructure or phishing websites.
Use the trusted domain to attack the general public.
This is of major concern. Thanks."

@ Inject 2: Vulnerability exploitation
! content
24 hours after receiving the message from social media,
someone has taken over the vulnerable subdomain and is hosting phishing and social engineering content from a third-party site.
This is being done to take advantage of your users’ trust in your website and domain.
You do not immediately notice this but reports pertaining to the malicious content start circulating in online forums and social media.

# discussion
+ Do you have a procedure in place to respond to and address exploitation of security vulnerabilities on your website?
+ Are the relevant people in your organisation aware of the process, and how to quickly address the issue and engage with any relevant service providers and authorities?
+ Are you able to respond to the incident internally or do you require external assistance?
+ Do you consider attempting to communicate with the original reporter of the vulnerability to try to help regain control of your subdomain, or do you attempt to address the problem without their assistance?
+ Would you respond to any of the posts on social media or forums?

# prompts
+ What policies and procedures do you have to quickly address and mitigate vulnerabilities?
+ Are the procedures manual or facilitated by specific systems including automation and alerting?
+ Is everyone aware of the process and who is responsible for engaging with various third parties?
+ Which authorities might the organisation involve?
+ If the team managing this incident requires assistance, is there a method of escalation?

The Post Incident Review (PIR) highlights that if the organisation had identified and responded to the initial vulnerability report, the incident could potentially have been avoided.
Your organisation seeks guidance to implement a vulnerability disclosure process as soon as possible.

# discussion
+ Do you have a vulnerability disclosure process that is easy to follow for external reporters and fully understood by all the relevant people in your organisation?
+ Are any additional systems or training necessary to ensure the process is effective when required?

# prompts
+ Will provision of a vulnerability disclosure process require further discussion and reviews?
+ If you already have a process how often has this been tested?
+ Can you make any necessary changes to your website to publicise the process?
+ Do you have nominated contact information and is the contact available all day every day?
+ Do you have the means to respond to reports in a given timeframe?

? Our organisation has an effective vulnerability disclosure process in place or plans to implement this soon following further discussions and approvals.
