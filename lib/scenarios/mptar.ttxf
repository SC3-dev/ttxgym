A user travelling by train to a meeting misplaces an organisation-provisioned mobile phone, only noticing after they have left the station.
Unfortunately, it soon falls into the hands of an opportunistic thief.
The thief believes it is a personal phone and attempts to access it in case it has saved payment details, or is still logged into an online shop.

# discussion
+ What authentication methods are in use for mobile devices? Are users required to set up a PIN, a password or biometrics to prevent unauthorised access?
+ How does your organisation support users in setting suitably complex PINs and passwords or appropriate biometrics?
+ How does your organisation enforce or measure effective use of these protections?

# prompts
+ What authentication options are users required to use? How is it enforced?
+ Do we teach users the importance of setting a suitably secure password or PIN?
+ Is there any technical enforcement of password or PIN complexity rules? If so, what are they?
+ When are users required to setup authentication? Is it when they are first provided with the device?
+ Is there any way a user could avoid setting up these protections?

? We ensure any portable devices, such as mobile phones, that are used to access business information are suitably protected, for example by a complex PIN, password or secure biometric.

The thief, having failed to gain access to the phone, sells it on to a dealer who in turn sells it to a criminal hacker who specialises in gaining access to locked devices.
The hacker makes money by gaining access to devices and selling extracted information, or payment card details.
An old version of the software running on the device is known to have a security issue that would allow the hacker to bypass the lock screen.

# discussion
+ How regularly are usersâ€™ devices updated? Is this enforced or can they delay updates indefinitely?
+ If the hacker was able to gain access to the phone, what information would they be able to access?
+ What would the business impact be of losing control of that information?

# prompts
+ Do we know a typical timescale for devices being updated?
+ What happens if the user never updates their device?
+ What methods do we have for measuring the update status of our devices?
+ What communication apps are available? For example: email, conferencing, telecoms, or project management apps?
+ As well as information, do phones let employees access other systems, such as the ability to make purchases, or control some aspect of operations?

? We ensure software updates for devices and applications are installed as soon as possible.

Upon being notified that the device has been lost, your organisation presumes it has been stolen and wishes to ensure that information on the phone is not compromised.

# discussion
+ What abilities do you have to remotely disable or wipe the phone? Are there any limitations on these techniques?
+ What data is stored on the phone? What would the impact to the business be if this was compromised?
+ Can you track the device once it has been lost?

# prompts
+ How would you remotely disable or wipe the phone?
+ Does this rely on access to network connectivity?
+ How long is this technique likely to work for?
+ Would you be able to continue normal operation?
+ Do you have this data stored in any other location?

? If a device is lost or stolen, we can remotely track, wipe, or disable it.
