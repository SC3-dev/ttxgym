! title: Home and remote working
! summary
This scenario explores the events that take place where employees in your organisation need to work remotely at short notice and require access to the IT services used by your organisation.
It includes connecting your employees to the systems used by your organisation via non-corporate internet connections, the processes and monitoring in place to enable secure distributed communication amongst your users using various online systems, and your processes for handling the compromise of information from your organisation when working remotely.
Discussion of the above topics will help you explore the controls your organisation has in place to facilitate effective distributed working and to identify and respond to the compromise of information from your organisation.
